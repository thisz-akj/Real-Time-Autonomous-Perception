# Real-Time Autonomous Perception for robots

###YOLOv8 + DeepSORT + Custom Color Dataset

###This project implements a real-time object detection and tracking system using:

-YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for fast, accurate object detection

-DeepSORT for multi-object identity tracking

-MARS appearance embeddings for robust ID assignment

-A custom dataset of colored objects annotated in CVAT

-This pipeline is designed for robotics, autonomous systems, and real-world perception tasks, where reliable, ID-consistent tracking is essential.

 ##Features

✔ Custom YOLOv8 detection model (trained on your dataset)
✔ DeepSORT tracker upgraded for TensorFlow 2.x
✔ MARS appearance model (mars-small128.pb) integration
✔ Supports video input, image input, and webcam
✔ Saves an annotated output video with unique track IDs
✔ Fully reproducible pipeline — dataset → training → tracking

##Dataset Description

This project uses a self-created dataset of colored objects (Red, Blue, Yellow).
Images were captured in various environments to improve real-world robustness.

##Dataset Preparation Steps

-Collected ~80 images containing colored samples

-Annotated using CVAT with bounding boxes

-Exported annotations in CVAT XML format

-Converted XML → YOLOv8 TXT labels via custom Python script

-Split into train (80%) + val (20%) folders

-Generated dataset.yaml for YOLOv8
